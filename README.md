# ssh_concat

My first mini project in Rust !

On my hard disk, in my client directory, I have become accustomed to storing for each of my clients an ssh-config file that contains an SSH configuration extract, and, using a small BASH script, I concatenate all these ssh-config files in my main file .ssh/config

The purpose of this project is to do the same in Rust, just to learn the language.
